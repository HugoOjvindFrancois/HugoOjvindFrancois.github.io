It all begin when I lost my phone in December of 2017. For the rest of the week I had no device to use as an alarm, thus I arrive late every day for class.
This situation could not continue !
Desperate for way to wake up, I thought to myself : "I am a computer science student, I should just program an Alarm clock on my computer !". And so I did.

I wrote the [program](https://HugoOjvindFrancois.github.io/AlarmClock) in java.

The current release feature a command line support for the hour than the minute of the day (24h format) and it play a music from path to local wav music file.
